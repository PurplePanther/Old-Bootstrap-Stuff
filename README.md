# Old-Bootstrap-Stuff

***These files were intended to help me get reacquainted with Bootstrap and JavaScript***

"Try to Replicate 1" was my attempt to recreate the layout of a website as closely as possible

"Subfauxtique" was my attempt to recreate the layout of the Subeautique on subeta.net as closely as possible

"Dropdown Practice", "3 Panel Row" and "Layout Practice" are my exploration of different layout elements

"JavaScript Inputs" is my getting reacquainted with onclick() in JavaScript
